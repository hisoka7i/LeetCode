    At today's contest, I learned an important trick to delete elements from a linked list
    So, the trick is to create a dummy element and set it as the pervious pointer. We will have 2 pointers
    one at current element and other one at previous element.
    Refer to DeleteNodes.java in Contest/WeeklyContest folder
